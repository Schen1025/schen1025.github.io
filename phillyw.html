    <div class="container">
        <p>For the workshop in Philadelphia, I went to Iffy books zine making workshop. Before going I thought of this as a typical workshop like pottery making or the pop-up card, but the process was much simpler than I imagined. Going into the store, I got to explore the space before Steve sat me down and started instructing us on the process of zine making. It was nostalgic finding my childhood favorites are the shelves of the store. The process was only two steps, staple the zines and then stack and sort them. The only decision that had to be made was how many staples to put on each zine as the thicker zines needed a few more staples.</p>

        <p>While stapling them, I would stop and take a look at what the zines were saying. The zines ranged in topics, with interesting piece on how to destroy government surveillance on your phone to simple comics for kids. The process was mainly repetitive, as Steve brought over freshly print zines while we kept folding them. The process was surprising enjoyable, something about the repeated nature of it not only brings a sense of calmness but also a sense of achievement. I got really good at stapling them to a point that I was able to fold them faster than the speed of the printer printing them out.</p>

        <p>Steve brought over boxes for me to fold while I was waiting for the newly printed zines. The boxes are going to for giving local children gifts on Christmas. As the process continued for hours before I even noticed, Steve came over with the last batch of freshly printed zines. Before heading out, Steve gave me an Iffy books t-shirt as a way to welcome me to their community.</p>

        <p>The process of making zine is extremely similar to the Printing in Prisons project when we generated data and transcribed it to the excel sheet. Both processes were not difficult in the sense of a lot of thought had to be put in before the action. The work was both time consuming and repetitive, but it is also important work. Without spending time putting the zines together, there would be no zines, and the store would not have zines to sell. Same for transcribing the newspaper into excel, the work is important in the preservation of data and also helps people when searching for something in the future.</p>

        <p>It made me reflect on the things in life we don&rsquo;t really pay attention to. As an Economics major, I thought back to the first time I learned about division of labor back in high school. There are tons of important work that goes unnoticed but gets done every day so we can live how we live. The difference in zine folding and what we learned in digital humanities is that the metadata generated online will last a lot longer than the zines I stapled. I also don&rsquo;t have to think of the lasting impact of the zine or put myself in the shoes of the writer of the zine.</p>

        <p>As we move into a digital age, books are starting to be more and more a luxury item compared to what it was before. eBooks and audio books are being more and more common for daily use like leisure reading or for classes. The prices of eBooks are normally a fraction of the cost of a physical book, and it is now often integrated with technology that help individuals understand the materials better. Even though to be frank, the process was boring and repetitive at the end of the session. I probably will never go back again to do this workshop, but I do appreciate experience and the memories it brought back of younger me spending hours reading in the book store.</p>
