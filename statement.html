        <p>Going into digital humanities this fall, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to expect as the only other humanities class I took at Penn was the writing seminar. I wanted to keep an open mind to whatever we were doing, but didn&rsquo;t really understand what digital humanities meant despite knowing both of the words making up the phase. Throughout the course of the semester, the meaning of digital humanities started to form. I remember it was watching the video by Kim Christen, &ldquo;press pause: slowing down digital humanities practices&rdquo;, where I first started to see the factors needing to be considered in the digitization of anything. This was a foreign concept to me prior to this class despite spending a significant amount of my time online every day. As a criminology major and statistic minor, I work with loads of data and analyze them, but never really had to question the ethical side of the data or if there is an owner of this data that I don&rsquo;t know about. I never understood the difference between online data and metadata. Even though the saying is ignorance is bliss, I am grateful that I am no longer ignorance of data ownership, metadata versus data, and its lasting effects.</p>

        <p>My favorite part of the class was doing work with Eastern State Penitentiary. Criminology is something I picked up after coming to Penn. Even though I likely will not have the chance to put the degree to use, I am grateful to have been exposed to it. As the intersection of economics, politics, and psychology, it connected all my interests and showed me a part of the world that is not often talked about and often misunderstood. While working on Eastern State relating projects, like the printing in prison and the multi-media essay. I was reminded of the things I learnt and was able to incorporate my understanding of the criminal justice system in the some of my pieces. But the visit to the Penitentiary was different. It was difference because it offered me a way to look at incarcerated not as criminals, but as humans who are living in their own society. In criminology, we often forget the experience of incarcerated individuals. I&rsquo;m glad to have the chance to explore the stories of the incarcerated and what they were able to achieve even in constraint and not look at them for the crime they committed but for the human that they are.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on the work I did, I think I tried to put my best effort into each of the pieces I submitted. I was engaged at the workshops despite it not being where you&rsquo;ll expect to find me, and I actually found it quite rewarding. It reminded me of when I first tried out yoga back in high school. I&rsquo;ve always been skeptical but found it very beneficial as soon as I started taking it seriously. Throughout the workshops, I was not only able to reflect on what we learned in class and explore the difference between working with online data and physical projects but also got the chance to interact with people that I&rsquo;ve never met before in both the Penn and Philadelphia workshops. I was really glad that I went alone to these workshops, so I can really focus on what we were doing and not be distracted by my friends. But there are also things that I wish I have done differently. Even though I worked really hard on all the pieces, I rarely actively sought for feedback. Looking back, I really appreciate the feedback my classmates gave me and did edits based on them. This is something I wish I did one more of my work. Sometimes an improvement is really obvious when someone else points it out.</p>

        <p>Like I will mention in my forward-looking statement, this class also sparked my interest in learning more about computer languages and coding. Even though as a senior, there might not be as much time learning about it at Penn, but I plan on continuing this journey pass graduation and learning bit by bit on my own time. It also raised awareness about my digital footprint. When I read about huge lawsuits against big tech companies like Meta or TikTok in 2023, I used to never understand what it was for. I thought, so what if they were using my data. They are trying to improve my lives by showing me the best ads. But I started to understand the importance of data and the importance of control with online data as we explored the class. The digital data will likely be online for an extremely long time. As we move into the digital age, our data become valuable assets and having other people labeling our data can be a fairly scary thing. I hope to carry what I learned in this class further along in my life and be more mindful when interacting with all forms of digital data.</p>
