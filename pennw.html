        <h1>Penn Workshop: Pop-up Card Making</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p>I went to the pop-up card making workshop at Penn on December 4. At the workshop, we made two popup Christmas cards, which was just in time as I didn&rsquo;t do any Christmas shopping yet. Growing up, I enjoyed arts and crafts, but the last time I&rsquo;ve done something like this was in middle school. Other than the EC project, this was also the first time I&rsquo;ve attended any workshop. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, but the teachers there were all really friendly and patient. It was interesting to see not only students being there, but also faculty or even family of faculty.</p>

        <p>The card itself wasn&rsquo;t too hard to make, but there were many steps that had to be followed alone closely. We had to combine four pieces of paper in one card, and two pieces of paper into another. We started off by folding the paper to 16 folds to mimic the branches of trees. At first it seemed a little bit extra, but that was a crucial step to make the Christmas tree look as good as it does. Then we used double side tape to connect the pieces to the main card. The second card involved a lot more cutting and less folding. We created a scene for snowman and Christmas trees to stand on. Both cards had three dimensional features that I never thought I could make before this workshop.</p>

        <p>During the workshop, I thought about the lessons in our digital humanities class. To some degree, it reminded me of creating our own GitHub page, following each step shown on the board. Each step by itself is not complicated, but the final result is a complex creation that might seem extremely hard to create at first sight. I enjoyed the process a lot more than I expected, leaving the workshop as the late person as I wanted to perfect the design of my second card. Overall, the experience was really positive, and I will put the card to good use this Christmas.</p>

        <p>Creating a card as a physical product is fundamentally different compared to most of the things we did in class, but for some reason it reminded me of the process of putting metadata on the web. During the workshop, we had a double-sided tape we used to put everything together. The double-sided tape was really forgiving as you could peel it off without hurting or tearing the paper. But after you stick both sides to the papers and let it sit for a minute; it&rsquo;s going to hold the two pieces of paper together with a strong force. This reminded me of putting metadata and labeling work online.</p>

        <p>When the labeling happens it could easily be changed to whatever the individual wants. But when everything is said and done, the impact it could have is much greater than that of a double sided tape holding together paper. Using the &ldquo;Difficult Heritage and the Complexities of Indigenous Data&rdquo; reading as an example, often times there are aspects there are not considered enough before completing an action. Even though in the case of metadata, it can be altered after it is created, some of the damages its done can no longer be reversed. Therefore with each step, we should handle the different pieces with care, no matter if it&rsquo;s making a pop up card or creating metadata or some other object that is likely going to be on the internet for a long period of time.</p>
