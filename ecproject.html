EC Project Reflection
For the EC project I was in the textile group and had a role of digital asset manager. Before deciding on anything, my group met together and learned about how to use the sewing machine in the education commons. This part was important as we learned about the limitations of the machines and decided that we cannot make an extremely complex design as the machine can only handle a thin fabric. For the tote bags, Christine had to break the bag down to put into the sewing machine and sew them back after the stitching was done. Given the time constraint on the project, we decided to choose a material that would fit into the machine and would require limited work after.
After understanding the equipment, the group came together to brainstorm about the idea. We knew we wanted to create a textile relating to sports, as we knew that was an important part of the life of the incarcerated. We wanted to create something that meant a lot to most of the participants of sports within the Eastern State Penitentiary, so we started looking at the umpire to try to find a meaningful symbol that would resonate with many. We looked at many descriptions of local Phillies and even the Penn varsity baseball game. But we ultimately decided on doing something that focused on the Penitentiary more, the first recorded game of baseball between two teams within the Penitentiary. It was not only the first game recorded with every inning, but also on issue 1 volume 2 of the Umpire. This meant that it was also a key part of the Umpire.
Now that we have a specific event in mind, all we had to do was to decide how we should express the game in the form of a textile. I suggested the idea of a baseball bat patch with the names of the team and the score stitched onto the bat. Although some of the team liked this idea, one of my teammates thought that would put too much focus on winning or losing the game rather than the process. To improve upon this idea, another teammate came out with the concept of the scoreboard, as it represents the whole process of the game. The innings when teams scored and the innings when teams didn’t score were both on the scoreboard. This represented the spirit of sports, as sometimes it’s not the final score that matters the most, but the process of working together as a team and getting there. The entire time loved this concept, and we decided to move on with it.
For the design, our designer and fabricator put some really nice elements onto the patch. Even though we didn’t want to focus on the Phillies, we decided to use their color as the combination of the patch to pay respect to our local baseball team. This made sense as the Phillies were mentioned in the passage right after the article about the first baseball game in the penitentiary. Even though the machine ran into a lot of issues that we couldn’t figure out the source, I wanted to give credit to our designer and fabricator for being extremely patient with the process and checking each step of the way to see if it could have been the cause of the problem. In the end, it was finishing the white base that cleared all of the problems we were having. The end product was a patch you could put on a uniform or a backpack, representing pride in taking part of sports in the penitentiary and also a sense of belonging to the team.
My part was the digital asset manager, and I was in charge of taking care of all the digital files and assets relating to the project. Other than brainstorming for the topic and adjusting on the design, I also credited digital files to record each of our roles and write down a plan for the making of the patch. I also gathered information about each of the groupmates to ensure we had a channel to communicate even during the thanksgiving break. A problem I ran into as the digital asset manager was that I didn’t have the software that was compatible with the sewing machine, so I couldn’t create the file for the patch at the time of the meeting. Despite the challenges faced, all of the group members were actively communicating solutions on the progress of the project and came up with a solution. Even though the project ran quite smoothly, I believe we could have made more improvements if we had more time working on the project. If given more time, our group likely would have made multiple patches with one for each team, providing personalization to each of the teams. Overall, the group worked together to deliver a piece that we were all proud of.
