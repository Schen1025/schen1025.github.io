        <h1>EC Project Reflection</h1>
        <div class="section-title">Learning the Equipment</div>
        <p>Before deciding on anything, my group met together and learned about how to use the sewing machine in the education commons. This part was important as we learned about the limitations of the machines and decided that we cannot make an extremely complex design as the machine can only handle a thin fabric.</p>
        <p>For the tote bags, Christine had to break the bag down to put it into the sewing machine and sew them back after the stitching was done. Given the time constraint on the project, we decided to choose a material that would fit into the machine and would require limited work after.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Brainstorming the Idea</div>
        <p>The group came together to brainstorm ideas. We wanted to create a textile relating to sports, as we knew it was an important part of life for the incarcerated. After looking at umpire descriptions, local Phillies games, and the Penn varsity baseball game, we focused on the first recorded baseball game between two teams within the penitentiary. This was featured in <em>Issue 1, Volume 2 of the Umpire</em> and became our central theme.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Design Process</div>
        <p>I suggested the idea of a baseball bat patch with the team names and score stitched on. While some liked this idea, one teammate pointed out it could focus too much on winning or losing. To improve this, another teammate suggested a scoreboard design, which represented the process of the game rather than just the outcome. We loved this concept and moved forward with it.</p>
        <p>Our designer and fabricator incorporated thoughtful elements into the patch. We used Phillies colors to honor the local team since they were mentioned in the article following the game. Despite sewing machine challenges, the designer's patience ensured a smooth process. The finished product was a patch that could be worn with pride, symbolizing teamwork and belonging.</p>

        <div class="section-title">My Role: Digital Asset Manager</div>
        <p>As the digital asset manager, I handled all digital files and assets related to the project. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brainstorming for the topic</li>
            <li>Adjusting the design</li>
            <li>Creating a digital plan for making the patch</li>
            <li>Gathering team information for communication during Thanksgiving break</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One challenge I faced was not having software compatible with the sewing machine to create the patch file during our meeting. However, with active communication, the team found solutions and maintained progress.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Reflections and Improvements</div>
        <p>The project ran smoothly overall, but with more time, we could have made additional patches, one for each team, for personalization. This would have enhanced the final output.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, our group delivered a product we were all proud of, thanks to strong teamwork and problem-solving throughout the project.</p>

        <p class="team-credit">"The spirit of sports is not just the final score but the process of working together as a team and getting there."</p>
